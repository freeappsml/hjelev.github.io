# In this article I'll explain how I installed LetsEncrypt certificate for my home-assistant instance that is behind a nginx reverse proxy.

1. We need to install Letâ€™s Encrypt:
   <pre>$sudo apt-get install certbot</pre>
  
2. Once LetsEncrypt is installed we have to generate the certificate:
    <pre>$sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com</pre>
    
(You need to replace example.com with your domain name)

The certificate files will be located at: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com`

3. Once the certificate is generated we need to modify the nginx configuration file for that domain.
The configuration file that we need to modify is located in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` .

nginx config file:
(this is the nginx configuration I have used to enable SSL for my Home-assistant setup.)

    <pre>
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }
    server {
    	listen 80;
    	listen 443 ssl;
        server_name example.com;
        access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    	ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://192.168.0.103:8123;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_redirect http:// https://;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        }
    
    }
    </pre>

4. Check if the changes you have made to nginx configuration files are valid:
  <pre>$nginx -t</pre>

5. Reload Nginx Configuration:

  <pre>$sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload</pre>

6. Renew your certificates:

Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. To renew your expiring certificate(s) use the command below:

   <pre>$sudo certbot renew</pre>
