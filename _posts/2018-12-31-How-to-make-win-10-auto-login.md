# How to Make Windows 10 Automatically login without password.

If you are like me and don't like to enter passwords each time you use your home computer, you'll like this.

This is the easiest way to automatically login to Windows 10 without entering the password.

1. Open Run command box by simultaneously pressing Windows logo and R keys (Windows+R). In the Run dialog box, type **Netplwiz** and then press Enter key.
2. In the resulting User Accounts dialog, select your user account first and then uncheck the option labeled **Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer**. Click Apply button to see Automatically sign in box.
3. In the Automatically sign in dialog, type your password and then re-enter the password to confirm the same.

Restart your computer to make sure it is working.
